# TDDT
Test Driven Developer Training is an attempt to help somebody completely new to programming learn how to write well structured, fully test code from the start. 
There is plenty of courses online, even more 'hello world' examples. All you have to do is watch a video, or copy and paste a little bit of code and it just 'works'. In my experience they don't help much in terms of learning to code. There are so popular kata's that are great to keep your skills fresh, or even to learn some new techniques, or tricks, but they don't help at all in terms of deciding what one needs to learn to become a developer. 

So what is it that one has to learn to be able to program in 2018? There is a miriad of choices across multiple categories:
* The problem solving skills - algorythms, data structures and such
* The IDEs, repos and such - tools one uses to produce code
* The programming languages - one is typically not enough
* The standard frameworks and libraries - not to reinvent the wheel
* The theory and the acronyms - SOLID, CAP, ACID, TDD and such

# Practice Makes Perfect 

Hopefully you managed to follow the instructions to the end and now you have a fully tested Hello World application. That means you understand more than at the beginning as to what it takes to write a set of instructions for a computer to perform a simple action and how to do it well. But could you do it on your own yet? Probably not, and if that is the case I suggest rather than trying to do something more complex now, you go back and start this Hello World application again. Can you remember the steps? Can you remember the commands? Can you remember the code? Do it again and again, until you can do 80% without looking at the instructions.
